@andrewburer Yes, he is good. But think about if Ducks had lost Mariota at start of season, put Lockie, lost Lockie .... so it is amazing.

@JeffPassan Buckeyes different team now. Barrett gets better with each game. Not bad for a team who lost their QB 11 days before that game!
RT @JeffPassan: How the hell did Ohio State lose to Virginia Tech?
I can hear band playing Carmen Ohio on TV!!!!!!
Yay!!!! Great game #Buckeyes!!!!!!!!!
Oops -- make that 12
#Spartans still fighting. Cut lead to 11 with 5 minutes left. Watch out for onside kick. #Buckeyes
@andrew_galvin That was an incomplete pass. No interception -- in my book!
@andrew_galvin Yeah -- that loss surprised me.
@andrew_galvin True. But I think momentum is on #Buckeyes' side. Even when they fumbled twice in first half -- they were leading.
@andrew_galvin OK -- I think that is gonna do it for the #Buckeyes!!!!!!!
Ohhhh -- J.T. Barrett -- that was a nice 55-yard carry. #Buckeyes.
@andrew_galvin I still think #Buckeyes are gonna win.
#Spartans still alive. They just score. #Buckeyes lead 42-31 ..... about 9 minutes left.
@jonhornUTSD @KeithDarce That essentially covers most teams in San Diego -- sans men's Aztec basketball!
@jonhornUTSD I hope #LSU can knock off #Alabama. Cheering for @KeithDarce's alma mater!
I think #Buckeyes just sealed the deal with that one. They lead #Spartans 42-24 in the 4th!
#BUCKEYES!!!! Stretch the lead with that touchdown!!!!!!!!!! O-H ....
@jonhornUTSD Yikes!!!!!! Altho I think momentum is with the #Buckeyes. They are moving!!!!! Loving it!
Elliott scores. #Buckeyes up 35-24 in the 3rd. Tons of time left in this game. Don't count #Spartans out.
@jonhornUTSD Yup -- that was a sweet one from Barrett. #Buckeyes doing good. Now -- no more special team fumbles!!!!! (Good game so far!)
Yay!!!!! Who says #Buckeyes don't have a passing game. Beauty! TD!!!! For the lead.
Woot! woot!!! Look at Michael Thomas go! Touchdown #Buckeyes! And we're tied 21-21 with #Spartans!!!!
RT @davebiddle: That could be a huge momentum shift. First time #Buckeyes get a huge break. MSU has received more than their share thus far.
Thank goodness #Spartans stink at FG kicking ...... But #Buckeyes hanging in there despite dumb goofs! (cc @mcklem)
OK -- did someone grease the #Buckeye ball? Because this is 2nd special teams fumble. Gonna cost us. (cc @mcklem)
Rats. Sparty just scored again. #Buckeye D has got to get it together!!!!!!
Touchdown #Buckeyes!!!! This is gonna be a high-scoring game!!!!!!!
Penalties left and right in this #Buckeye v #Spartan game. C'mon guys. Settle down and play.
That was a super unfortunate specials teams fumble by #Buckeyes. Huge mistake.
@XmasStocking Cannot wait for your podcast to kick off fully!!!!!!
Yay!!!! #Buckeyes respond in 4 plays!!!!!!!! And they tie it up with #Spartans.
@laura_wingard Yup. Sparty scores first. My Dad's a pretty big Buckeye fan tho. Tonite -- well -- I think he's just hoping for a good game!
Rats. #Buckeyes missed big tackle. #Spartans score first.

MT @JeffPassan: Now California Chrome gets to go off and make babies for millions of dollars the rest of his life. It could be a lot worse.
I think Steve Coburn needs a Breathe Right nasal strip right now. #Belmont #CaliforniaChrome
@RantSports Totally disagree. That's why Triple Crown is so hard  to win. It's called strategy &amp; training. Steve Coburn is a sore loser.
The reason the Triple Crown is so tough is the schedule and the strategy. Keep the format. Lose the bitterness Mr. Coburn.
Steve Coburn -- Love your horse but stop whining about the Triple Crown series and how it is set up. You're being a sore loser now.
#CaliforniaChrome didn't have it in the stretch. I am done crying but so sad he didn't do it. That's why it's so hard to win.
He didn't have it in the stretch. I am done crying.
Love it. Crowd at #Belmont is chanting Go Chrome Go!!!!!!
Oh -- this explains it. Breathe Rite handed out nasal strips to everyone at #Belmont &gt; http://t.co/o9pKuCf8a5
Is Victor Espinoza wearing one of those nasal strips, too? Never noticed it before. #CaliforniaChrome #Belmont
Art Sherman is so classy. He just wished everyone a safe ride. #TripleCrown #CaliforniaChrome
I've got NBC on and many of the experts are saying #CaliforniaChrome won't win. They're picking Wicked Strong or Tonalist. #TripleCrown
Who are you picking to win the #Belmont? My trifecta: California Chrome, Wicked Strong, Commanding Curve.

@McKLEM Just got off phone with Mom. She was disappointed for #Badgers. She doesn't know who to pick for final. She sounded like Eeyore :)
@loriweisberg Kentucky has hit that shot in all of its clutch games -- and they've all been dramatic like that!
Ditto. RT @jarrodwalsh: I wish March Madness could go forever.
@loriweisberg Yup -- I was pacing the floor. So wanted Badgers to take Bo Ryan into the final game. But should be good final!
Hey @mcKlem -- How can we be No. 4 in the national ESPN group pool? Other pools must have had worse Ky-Wisc ratio.
Damn that young #Kentucky team. They're good. Beat the #Badgers by a point. Good, gut-wrenching game. #MarchMadness

Why do #Buckeyes keep running Hyde up the middle? He can run to the left or to the right .... #Tigers.
Yes!!!!! #Buckeyes intercept the ball!!!!! (I am doing a happy dance in front of the TV!)
Forget about the score -- these refs are sure calling a ton of penalties on both teams. #Buckeyes #Tigers

I think that's gonna be it. And most folks picked #ASU over Texas Tech. Not me! Fun game. #RedRaiders.
I am officially cold. Weather app says it is 50 degrees at Qualcomm. I need another blanket!
Love No. 11 on Texas Tech team. Grant. He's 160 pounds and only 5' 6" ... and boy can he run! #RedRaiders.
Texas Tech band wayyy better and more exciting than ASU band ( sun songs?)
The Texas Tech fans stand up with the "Guns Up" salute until injured #ASU fan is safely off field. #redraiders
@sdutCanepa Yeah, Red Raiders are fast but that 1st quarter was sooooo long!
That was the longest 1st quarter of college football ... #redraiders #sundevils
Uh oh. Fumble. #ASU has the ball.
#ASU on the scoreboard with a 44 yard FG. #redraiders

He missed it!!!!!!!!!! #Chargers
Tied. Will #Chargers defense do something cool? Like force a turnover? (I'm a #Buckeye so know anything -- win or lose -- is possible.)
@johnrlamb Usually they start playing better when I am in the room -- that happened last week.
The #Chargers seem to do better in this particular game when I leave the room -- kind of like that guy in the TV beer commercial.
Trying to keep the faith! RT @SDuncovered: May the fourth be with you, Philip.
Ack. Can you say choke? No, No, No. C'mon #Chargers.
RT @annieheilbrunn: That phrase "all the #chargers have to do is win against the KC backups" is sure heavy right now.
May odds be ever in our favor MT @UTgehlken:  If  Chargers can, at home, beat a Chiefs team resting 20 of 22 starters, they make playoffs.
It's final -- NY Jets beat Miami Dolphins 20-7 .... and now just waiting for end of Cincy vs. Baltimore. Then it's up to the #Chargers!!!!!!

@utlaurawingard I thought it was a good game. MSU defense shut down any offense we had late in game. And those penalties in 1st half - argh!
@McKLEM @ccfinlay -- MSU's D was good in 4th. And now the search for Rose Bowl tix begins. Gonna try to see Spartans v Stanford!
@ccfinlay @McKlem -- well yeah -- those penalties didn't help but that's all part of the game. Can't do that and win! Good game by Spartans.
@jmeucci Oh -- but that's because the SEC is superior. No one can beat an SEC team in football. Thank God for Big 10 basketball.
@McKLEM But we'll be back next year!
@McKLEM Yup. It's over. See earlier Tweet. And now the nation will get the BCS game they want. And I won't have to hear trash talk about OSU
OK -- and that's the game. Even this loyal #Buckeye knows the end. But it was a good battle. Don't mind losing to #Spartans.
@ccfinlay @McKlem -- Argh. (Mostly I can't stand the announcers but what's new?)
@ccfinlay @McKlem -- And now they're shutting down Hyde and Miller run game.
@McKLEM Receivers haven't been great and Miller's passing hasn't been either. So now we are 4-1. Yikes.
#Buckeyes need Roby!
RT @Birm: Braxton has not been great, but the #Buckeyes receivers have not helped him tonight.
Gotta say -- that was a beauty -- even if it was a #Spartan TD. C'mon #Buckeyes!
@utlaurawingard Rats. Pass interference -- again. They need Roby back in the game, too. But #Spartans will score on this drive.
@utlaurawingard #Buckeye D has been good but not right now! Too close. #Spartans have had some good plays!
@utlaurawingard A little bit, but did you see that last play? Argh. Still 4th Q to go!!!!! (That 1st Q was horrible!)
Gee #Buckeyes. Everyone could see that you were gonna run Miller on that play. Sigh.
@tonymanolatos Anyone's game but #Buckeyes playing like they should now. (My Dad is a Spartan. I was born in East Lansing.)
OK -- now you can throw out that stinky 17-0 comeback stat Fox. #Buckeyes tie it up. Anyone's ballgame now.
Yeah -- Molly from North Canton, Ohio. (Nice chest pass technique!) #Buckeyes
This woman is killing this guy in the football toss!
@PaulKiska re haters &gt;&gt; I know! What hype. #Buckeyes only down 7 and we have a whole half left to play.
@McKlem -- And what about #Duke? For a No. 1 team, #FSU is only up 17 at the half.
@McKlem -- Now how are you feeling?! Yup -- we're back in the game. Should be fun second half. #Buckeyes
@DufresneLATimes Still tons of time left in Michigan State-OSU game. And #Buckeye offense just showed up. (Oh Ye of Little Faith)
Yay -- Don't give it up yet folks! #Buckeyes just getting started.
@McKlem .. But I'm not giving up! #Buckeyes!
@McKlem -- OK -- Now I'm worried. #Buckeyes (Altho since the rest of the nation already expected this I suppose no one else is shocked.)
@McKLEM Hummmm -- we'll see. Still early. Those 10 pts came off a ton of penalties. But after that last sack -- not thrilled.
@McKLEM Yeah. Dumb penalties. Let's hope they get it out of their system now. That scoreboard could be worse with all yardage we gave up!
I'll take it after all if those penalties! #Spartans can't get a TD with all of those #buckeye gifts!
Damn. 2nd first down on penalties. C'mon #Buckeyes. You have this game.
Wow! Two awesome Big 10 bands on the field for national anthem! #Buckeyes

@Crisis_Mgmt_Ltd I get the Big 10 Network in San Diego! I like Michigan this year. Think best of Big 10.
@crisis_mgmt_ltd That said -- Miami is a good team. They weren't having a great night but they still played well and won.
@crisis_mgmt_ltd re Miami &gt; Did we watch the same game? Miami wasn't exactly on fire. They didn't play any better than IU.
@crisis_mgmt_ltd So you would've given IU's No. 1 seed to????
@crisis_mgmt_ltd Re IU -- True sign of a good team -- they win when they're having a bad day. IU might not be best. But they are good team.
@crisis_mgmt_ltd He earlier said Mountain West better than Big 10. I'm first to admit when Big 10 stinks. Sir Charles just likes East Coast.
@crisis_mgmt_ltd No -- he totally has been dissing the Big 10. He didn't even mention Ohio St. He did give a nod to Illinois for game plan.
#CharlesBarkley can't admit when he's wrong about Big 10 v Mountain West. He is entertaining to listen to but totally biased.
Great game by Fighting #Illini. Am sure many folks didn't think they'd stick that close to Miami, including #CharlesBarkley. #MarchMadness
@crisis_mgmt_ltd That should've been Illinois ball. Oh well .... #MarchMadness
@crisis_mgmt_ltd The Miami/Illinois game is on TNT.
@crisis_mgmt_ltd Yay! So happy for LaSalle! DoinPhilly proud!!!! (I admit -- @mcklem influenced my decision to pick 'em) #MarchMadness

@mcklem Michigan also in Auburn Hills?
@mcklem How did MSU get to play in Auburn Hills?
@mcklem LVille hot. Miami looked good today. I like IU -- just for sentimental reasons. And then I'm up in the air. (Haven't watched GT)
@mcklem &gt; This is the non-chocolate candy in the house. Spice. Blech. http://t.co/oYu08zLFCi
@ccfinlay True. But the love for the Big East is overdone. Snoring. (cc @mcklem)
@mcklem -- So do you think Steve Alford's team a sleeper in the tourney?
CBS thinks Big East is best conference. Ohhhhh -- cry me a river ..... no imagination. #MarchMadness
@mcklem OK -- here we go. CBS now bashing the Big 10 -- says overrated. #MarchMadness
@mcklem You mean the Star Wars room! (I can sleep on the big couch downstairs.) Dad just showed me some candy that he has for Laura.
@ccfinlay But they don't play anyone. They have a weak conference. (cc @mcKlem)
@mcklem Does that mean I have to sleep in the haunted bug room?!
@mcklem re Zags. You watch tho .... they'll get a No. 1 seed. I mean -- who do they actually play. Very weak conference for 'em.
@mcklem Is Ira coming this weekend? (I am sooooo tired of the Big East story .... )
@mcklem Altho I think Zags are overrated .....
@mcklem I just sent but forgot to cc you: Kansas, Zags, Indy, Louisville
My picks for No. 1 seeds: Louisville, Indiana, Zags, Kansas #MarchMadness
@mcklem re Cheetos .... just had a few last nite. I tasted Sandy's Greek yogurt ... blech. Have had lots of fruit tho.
OK -- about 30 minutes to selection show. Your No. 1 seeds? (cc @mcklem) #MarchMadness
Yay!!! #Buckeyes win Big 10 title!!!!!! (Wisconsin goes last 7 minutes without a basket!)
@mcklem re Wisconsin/3 -- and they are so much bigger. They should've been jamming the smaller OSU lineup.
@mcklem Mom happy now bc we are into free throws and that's good for Buckeyes.
@mcklem However, I plan to make a j-bean run before the tourney starts. We have to have a small bag. It's tradition.
@mcklem Actually, there is not a single jelly bean in the house. They're pushing cookies and that Biscoff spread. But so far no go for me.
@mcklem Mom just declared "This is a boring game." #buckeyes
@mcklem Ummmmm -- i think cabbage. You know, it's St. Patrick's Day.
@mcklem Yes, but she is playing solitaire on my iPad and keeping one eye on the game ....
@mcklem At this rate we won't reach 50 points ....
Housing investors buy in bulk, profit in hard-hit areas but critics say it's ironic that Wall St is buying Main St: http://t.co/djcm4PYt4D
@mcklem Actually, I am surprised the score is as "high" as it is .... snoring.
@mcklem No. 31 for Wisconsin has some serious carrot-top hair .... does no one want to score in this game? #buckeyes
@lastbitepodcast @Kelly_LastBite But -- like you said on podcast -- does the Codex mean last book is gonna leave us hanging? No HEA etc?

@mcklem Yup. We just finished watching Miami win and VCU lose so now we have the Buckeyes on.

@mcklem I liked blowing out to the bottom. And then there was scuba diving!
@mcklem Nope -- I didn't but Phelps has slightly faster times in shorter races. Plus -- maybe Lochte tired? He totally blew that lead.
@mcklem re swimming. Yes -- I loved it, especially once learned how to breath! Hated coming out into cold weather. Head always got stuffy.
@mcklem Yes -- some bad "packeting" with the livestream. I hate how they do the commercials. (At least we have the countdown)  cc @NBCSports
.@mcklem -- My math might be off but Phelps swam a 47.15. Lochte a 47.74. France's Agnel swam a hot 46.74 in last leg. http://t.co/7gCCdGxl

We can push interest rates a bit lower. But the Twist also pushes investors into other securities that provide broader ease, #Bernanke says.
We think QE1 and QE2 did have significant impact, #Bernanke said. Fed Reserve is not partisan and will continue to be so, he says.
Monetary policy will not solve our problems, says #Bernanke who welcomes help from Congress. But he thinks Fed still has ammunition.

@ClaireNovak but do u think either will show for Belmont in 3 weeks? Shack has had 3 tough races. Motion likes to rest his horses.
@sdutSports and yes -- strategy -- slowing pace in middle -- smart. johnny V hesitated for second in bringing AK out.
@sdutSports totally exciting. Nah -- not bummed about lack of Triple Crown contender. Lots of good stories -- which is what  I like!!
@dippindotwoman Cannot wait for Belmont! My fave! Watched YouTube last nite the 1978 battle between Affirmed & Alydar!!!
@dippindotwoman Shack lead for most of the Derby . Just nice run. Love the closers but nothing like a horse runs from wire to wire!!!
@dippindotwoman Mike Smith did nice job with Astrology. Bummed about AK but great win by the Shack.
@sdutSports Gary picked the Shack. Wire to wire. Nice win. Bummed for AK, but good race. Now -- who will show up for Belmont!!!
OK .... go Animal Kingdom! Safe ride for all in #Preakness!
@sdutSports Sway Away ... What a sway back! Gary Stevens picks AK & Dialed In. I would keep eye on Mucho Macho Man. Bummer Nehro not here.
@sdutSports &gt; Which is why I'm a runner & not in horse biz!!! (AK a closer, too, tho!) I'm still going w AK . Gary likes Shackleford. You?
@sdutSports Still -- I hope AK can win but lots of contenders. Mucho ran well in derby even after little bump in home stretch.
@sdutSports yeah, but in track, if pace is slow -- that is good for runners who have good kick. Thot it would be same for equine closers.
Flashpoint -- the gray -- is pretty and the speed in the field. #Preakness

@GrantBarrett Great meeting you today. Enjoyed yr social media discussion. Lots of good ideas to build on. #asmj
@sduthopwood says to focus on discussions and quality of conversations & not number of followers. #asmj
What does yr audience use? Facebook? Text messages? Twitter?   Email? Find out and tailor to audience, says @sduthopwood.  #asmj
Engagement: be transparent, be human, listen, share, ask questions, says @ksablan #asmj
Twitter widgets: check out faves widget, storify for embeds, says @ksablan #asmj
How to use tweets in story? Just quote them, link to tweet, show tweet, says @ksablan #asmj
Twitter tip: use favorite button & lists to group & track tweets, says @ksablan #asmj
Twitter: how to verify? Check location, geotags, google info on twitter bio & look for email, phone, says @ksablan #asmj
Try the hashtags ... They can be useful but sometimes they yield noise, says @ksablan #asmj
Twitter tip: search without links for real people on scene. Tweak searches to find yr people for stories, says @ksablan #asmj
Personalize your messages. No blasts says @grantbarrett. #asmj
Social media is small part of journos job. It  is not answer to everything, says @grantbarrett #asmj
Join email lists, facebook pages, make contacts before u post yr stories online so you are prepped to go once story hits web. #asmj
Phone: key in online. Call sources & let sources know yr story is up, says @grantbarrett #asmj

OK -- told ya so .... #Buckeyes will grind it out. Never count us out.
And -- they went for 2 pts .... The Sweater Vest took a chance! #buckeyes
@BCastOZone re time .... might be .... but #buckeyes just showed ya it's 4 quarters of game ... & they r owning the second half.
@JLNME1 It'll be tight. Badgers are tough. But long-time Buckeye fans r used to living on the edge!
Nice to see @LanternSports live tweeting the game. Go Bucks!
@JLNME1 Well -- yeah. Bucks totally horrible first half. And since Badgers just scored -- she might have a few more choice words!
Well -- that's it for the #Buckeyes. #Wisconsin played great game.

Video taping of rodney king prolly first citizen journalism. Mainstream media picked up. #Jday10
10 Yrs ago, journalists worked in print. But www changed all of that. #Jday10
Blogs burst onto scene and people could comment. Myspace & facebook came along. #Jday10
Twitter made everything public & changed how we talk and see online. #Jday10
Journalists can't beat guy at scene w phone who tweets. #Jday10
Plane landing in hudson river great example of how twitter beat mainstream media. #Jday10
Curation pulls all tweets about event together in one spot. #Jday10
Journalists have to find that information. #Jday10
Journalists have to find context from twitter and confirm it. #Jday10
Order also key. Where do u place video. No standards rt now. #Jday10
Journalists must show they r the experts. Not just retweet. All part of curation. #Jday10
Journalists need to 'listen' first on twitter. #Jday10
Journalists need to cultivate online relationships just like they do face to face. #Jday10
It's all about conversations, listening, building relationships. u must engage. #Jday10
Citizen journalists who r credilbe will rise to top. U might see different tiers, says chris barr of yahoo. #Jday10

@TheBestSportMom yeah -- I'm looking at breakdown on Web & scratching my head. Not that your heart doesn't go out to Joannie, but ...
@twilightsparrow totally agree. joannie was downgraded on her jumps. Nagasu wasn't. U can compare stats online & see how they were judged.
@christhedunn yup -- scoring was very, very disappointing. I think even if Joannie had fallen, she would have received a medal.
@twilightsparrow everyone keeps saying nagasu is young & will be back. a lot can happen in 4 years. sometimes u only get one shot in life.
@msdc12 well -- not sure nagasu deserved silver but definitely bronze. very sad about the scoring.

Took short break from game to look for the white skunk ... and found it!
Waiting for Spartans v Cards to start.
Cards look like they're ready to burst out on a run ... can Spartans keep 'em in check? #NCAA
this is gonna be longest 4 minutes. Go Spartans! #NCAA
MSU is heading to Final Four!!! and who wondered about Izzo? #NCAA
Hey -- U can hate 'em but never count Izzo out. #NCAA
oh c'mon. refs called 'em bad both ways. KU just missed some key shots. #NCAA
Now -- onto ice dancing finals at worlds.
Why people will never take ice dancing seriously .... the judging still stinks.
Wants to look for the white skunk by her Mom's house but .....
Go Mizzou! #NCAA
Looks like uconn has this one wrapped up. good game tho. #NCAA
OSU hockey team getting killed by boston ... 5-0 ... only 2nd period. #NCAA
These NCAA games on now are total blowouts .... ugh.
NCAA: How many turnovers do the spartans have now? geesh.
I wouldn't Rock Chalk just yet #NCAA
Altho 10 spartan turnovers .... yuck. #NCAA
ack -- count it! #NCAA
That MSU bucket should count. It left his hands! #NCAA
Yea!!!!! MSU gets the basket. 36-29 KU leads. #NCAA
Be nice if we could see Zags on CBS now .... #NCAA
This is why I never pick Zags ... Pargo already has 3 fouls. #NCAA
UNC gonna blow Zags out of the water now. #NCAA
I just hope msu/ku game will tighten up or else this is one boring nite of bball. #NCAA
@justinhjones Totally agree. What a snoozer tourney.
Never count Izzo team out. Go Spartans! #NCAA
thank god for goran suton. at least this game close now! #NCAA
MSU needs Suton. argh. #NCAA
@RobGodfrey Great coach. big winner in big 10 ... 4 final 4s etc. Under-appreciated. Will he go to AZ? #NCAA
Spartans need to slow it down. Suton lucky he didn't get foul No. 4 coming down court last time. #NCAA
High double screen MSU. #NCAA
Bill Self does not look very confident. #NCAA
That was a horrible call. He tripped on his own feet. #NCAA
well -- bad calls. but KU missed shots and that evens out the bad officiating. #NCAA
SPARTANS WIN!!!!! Yea!!! #NCAA
Will be flipping between world ice-dancing finals and NCAA basketball ...
